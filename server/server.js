So, center is 1, conditional convergence at 5 means the radius is 4.  We know the series converges absolute (by ratio) on -3 &lt; x &lt; 5,            the series might converge at -3, might not, not enough info.

Question: Any self study precal to take calc bc advice?I am currently in algebra 2,            but plan to take pre calculus over the summer in order to take bc next year. For precal, i plan on using openstax, khan academy, and the course im required to take to self Possible Answer: In my            opinion, there are a few things you should learn or get more comfortable with in PreCalc that you *need* to know and there are a few things that are *good* to know, but aren't necessary.Here is what you          need to know:1. A general solid understanding of algebra and algebraic manipulation, as well as various important ideas in algebra such as factoring polynomials2. The trigonometric functions and their            graphs3. The unit circle and standard values for sine, cosine, and ideally tangent4. The inverse trigonometric functions and standard values for them5. Trig identities (specifically it is good to know          the double angle formulas and power lowering formulas for sine and cosine, as well as all of the pythagorean identities)6. A good understanding of exponential functions and logarithms as well as the          exponent and log rules7. An understanding of what sequences and series are and sigma notation for seriesHere is what is good to know but not necessary (you will need to know this eventually, but it is       going to be taught in your Calc class):1. A basic understanding of what tangent lines and secant lines are2. A basic idea of what limits and derivatives are3. How to do polynomial division and partial             fraction decomposition4. What polar functions are and how to graph them5. What parametric functions are and how to graph them6. What vectors are, what vector valued functions are, and what they             represent7. An understanding of what infinite series are, and possibly a more in depth understanding of geometric and power seriesThat's about all I can think of right now, but feel free to ask if there            is anything else you might be confused about (or if you're interested in private tutoring, feel free to dm me, but that can be pricey so no pressure).

I've tried multiple different sources for APUSH prep and            none have really helped me that much (The AP daily videos look very mid and the only thing that has been good is AMSCO). Any tips on source Possible Answer: I highly recommend Fiveable! It breaks down            every topic in its own page, has summaries for each topic and unit, and offers sample sbmc, saq, dbq, and leq. They also have videos from AP scorers, and they do ‚Äúcrams‚Äù in the days before the exam           (though you might have to pay, idk). Fiveable is my favorite, and it has stuff for every AP in case you take any others. Heimler‚Äôs History on YouTube is also pretty good, I recommend taking notes on his          videos but he breaks down each topic in its own videos, and does livestreams for each AP history leading up to the exams. All of my AP history teachers have sworn by him, too. AMSCO is obviously good, I          read and annotate the chapter summaries and make sure I can come up with examples for everything mentioned.

It is best to check the schools you wish to apply to and their pre med program          requirements.

I'll be            asking a few questions since I'm quite l Possible Answer: You have some severe misconceptions about APs. They are offered as regular classes at high schools. You sign up for them like you would any           other class. The classes are like any other class you would take in high school, just as a much faster pace. The policies around taking AP classes will depend on the school you attend Some school offer           all AP classes, some offer none, most sit somewhere in between. It depends on the school you will being attending. The prerequisites for AP classes also vary between schools. For example, one school        might require Algebra 2 for AP Physics, while another might only require Algebra 1. This is the same for grades, some might have a grade requirement, some might not. You can take as many AP exams as you            want, though I really would not recommend taking more than 10 total. AP tests cost $97, the cost of textbooks depends on which ones you end up buying."},

How t Possible Answer: Take notes and practice the hell out            of each section of the test, especially DBQs and FRQs. There‚Äôs also a ton of resources available online, be sure to use them. Heimler‚Äôs History on YouTube is a lifesaver. If your teacher doesn‚Äôt give           you this, the [AMSCO Textbook](https://tovarwhistory.weebly.com/uploads/9/3/7/7/93776476/amsco_2019_modern.pdf) is very useful. APs are more difficult than you expect. Most people (including me)          underestimate how difficult APs are before taking them. However, they‚Äôre rather manageable after you get used to the difficulty. I struggled for the first few months before I adjusted. APWH isn‚Äôt the         hardest AP, but it‚Äôs very time consuming. Be prepared to spent a lot of time on the class."},

I have started            studying for APUSH but was wondering if the exam is going to be super in depth like my unit tests. Or would it be rather broad or semi in  Possible Answer: I took the AP World exam last year so take            this with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm also a current APUSH student. I would look on the Course and Exam Description from the collegeboard, it breaks down what % of the exam each unit will be. As for the depth,          I think the exam was semi in depth. The most important things (for the writing) is knowing generalities and continuities but having examples for each. For example, if you argue that the Cold War changed            US foreign policy, give an example (or two, if you can) of US policy during the Cold War. For the sbmc, mossstttt of the time the answer will be in the stimulus, but when it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôll be something           from around the same period. I would try and get good at periodization and knowing what thing happened in what period, so you can make connections from the same period. Usually you can eliminate a          couple of choices just because they‚Äôre out of the period presented in the stimulus. I hope those tips help you in your studying, and may you see a 5 in July!!"},

Question: calc pls help, i never understood error bound‚Ä¶ignore the triangles, im             suffering Possible Answer: Let's suppose we have an alternating sequence s(n), and we are taking the sum of that sequence times the alternating part (in this case starting at 1, but it could start at             any number) up to some number k:n=1Œ£^(k)s(n)Then, let the error of this approximation be R. From the alternating series error bound, we know:|R| &lt;= |s(n+1)|I will not get into why this is true, but            if you are interested you can look it up. So, in our case, they took f(1/2) so our s(n) is going to be:s(n) = (-1)^(n+1)(1/2)^(2n)/(2n+1)!And because they want the fourth degree Taylor polynomial, that           means that the highest power of x should be 4, so that will happen at n = 2. Thus, they took the partial sum up to n = 2. Therefore, we can estimate our error bound R as:|R| &lt;= |s(2 + 1)| = |s(3)|           Thanks to the absolute value bars, we can drop the alternating part and get:|R| &lt;= (1/2)^(2√ó3)/(2(3)+1)! = (1/2)^(6)/(7)! = 1/(2^(6)(7!))And thus the answer is C, as shown."},

We know that cosŒ∏ is nothing but x/15, and in our          case the problem tells us that x is 9, so secŒ∏ is 15/9.

Question: My smooth brain doesn‚Äôt understand this (help)(AP Physics 2) Possible            Answer: Before the switch is closed the entire voltage of the battery (I will call this V) is across the capacitor (which I will say has capacitance C). So the charge on it initially is:qi = CVNow,           after the switch is closed, some current starts to flow through R1 and R2. We know that the voltage across the capacitor will be the same as the voltage across R2 as they are connected in parallel, but           we also know that R2 and the capacitor must share the total voltage of the battery with R1. This means that the capacitor has a smaller voltage across it than it did initially, and from the equation          earlier, a smaller V means a smaller q (because the capacitance remains constant) and thus we have:qf &lt; qiLet me know if you have any questions or if I made any mistakes!"},

How Possible Answer: There are a few key ideas that           are (usually) taught in PreCalc that you need for Calc BC, but nothing too difficult (in my opinion). These are:1. Partial Fraction Decomposition 2. Various trig identities and formula 3. Polar graphs            and equations 4. Parametric graphs and equations5. Vectors and vector arithmeticAnd of course, a strong foundation in algebra that often gets cultivated in PreCalc in general is very necessary for the          class, along with other stuff that you should have learned in prior classes (e.g. Factoring, log rules, unit circle). Additionally, if you're not as mathematically gifted, it's probably not a good idea         to just jump in. I suggest trying to go into the class with a good understanding of some of the basic concepts of Calculus *before* the class even starts (i.e. limits and how to find them algebraically         + what a derivative is and some basic derivative rules). Being ahead in Calculus makes the class significantly easier, so it is something I always strongly advocate for.If you need additional help, feel           free to ask me or others online as there are often people available (and if you're looking for a tutor, feel free to dm me as I do tutoring professionally).

A. What is the maximum speed of the tip of the needle? B. What is the ma Possible            Answer: Off the top of my head, I don‚Äôt recall how you would do A and B without calculus or just being provided equations. So let‚Äôs go with the latter: the equation for max velocity is that max v=(2pi*f)         *A and the equation for max acceleration is max a=(2pi*f)^2*A.(Side note: if you know calculus, yours just taking the first and second derivative of the postition equation from your formula sheet, x=Acos           (2pi*f*t), where A is amplitude and f is frequency, and then solving for the maximum x value which is the cos or sin function solves to 1.For C, you know the frequency, and you know that frequency is           the reciprocal of period. The time from the highest to lowest point is half of a cycle, so that‚Äôs half the period.For D, within a single cycle, the object will travel four times the amplitude. And          you‚Äôve already solved for period. So that should be easy from there."},

Possible Answer: If you have the choice between AP Lit and AP Lang, AP Lang is much better in the long run imo. A             passing score on the Lang exam will get you out of either a part of or the whole university/college writing requirement. Everyone has this requirement no matter what their major is. A passing score on            Lit will either get you credit for a basic 100-level lit course or, worst case scenario, english departmental credit.

Heimler has great content reviews and guides to answer all the MCQ, SAQ, DBQ, and LEQ on the exam.The            exam is more general than the content you learn in class so be sure to focus on overall themes connecting events together (SPICE-T) but still know specific examples relating to those themes.

Maybe that‚Äôs because I have an amazing teacher, but still, I highly recommend the course.  It‚Äôll make you aware of things many people in America aren‚Äôt, and you‚Äôll get a lot of college             credit for it, more than AP HUGE and World.  You won‚Äôt have to take an American history course again.As for pre-calc, I don‚Äôt recommend taking it.  90% of the stuff it covers isn‚Äôt used in Calc.  The             only thing that it does cover that you‚Äôll use in Calc is trig, but that‚Äôll be drilled into you regardless.  Take this from a Calc BC student who sat through five minutes of pre-calc once and didn‚Äôt             understand wtf was going on.  Instead, maybe you should take AP Stats since you‚Äôre a business major.  Or, you can jump straight to Calc AB.  Colleges will like it more, and again, you don‚Äôt need pre            calc at all.

Question: Do you think the AP course restrictions to specific grade levels and             requirements make sense in your school?While I graduated from HS and I haven't taken an AP exam in years, I still think about AP exams. In my high school, the requirements for AP courses do not make            sense.  Examples:  1) Only 9th graders Possible Answer: Our school does things very similarly. In 9th it‚Äôs because they want students to step into the rigor of AP gradually and Human Geo is a good AP           for that. In 10th AP world is taught as though it‚Äôs a first AP. They teach how to do DBQ, SAQ, MCQ as part of the course curriculum. At our school you could, hypothetically, take this class if you are            past 10th grade but I‚Äôve never seen anyone do it. We also allow AP Psych in 10th but I didn‚Äôt take it so I don‚Äôt know how they teach it. School suggests no more than 2 AP 10th grade year, I don‚Äôt know          if they allow exceptions. In 11th, we have free reign on most AP classes as long as we have completed the pre-requisites. Only exception is AP Lit which is 12th only. Our school suggests no more than 3         AP 11th grade but you can get an exception to do more. 12th grade can take any AP course offered as long as pre-requisites are met. Again, School suggested maximum is 3 AP but exceptions are made. For          any of these exceptions, you have to explain why you want to take the classes, how you plan to succeed, and you are expected to hold up your end of the deal. The system seems to work in favor of not           over-facing students and allowing them to increase rigor year over year."},

How to study effectively to pass the final exam? I got lost after my teacher reviewed chain rule.  Been Possible Answer: The best            suggestion I can give is to go back and review everything. If you didn't understand chain rule, you likely understood very little that you learned after that, so you need to be able to go back and          relearn that, as well as anything else that confused you before chain rule. Then, move through the curriculum up to wherever you are now. This process will likely take you a while, and you might need to            ask your teacher or a tutor for assistance, but there is really no other way to catch up than to do that. And don't wait to start doing this. You need to be reviewing *now*, because the longer you wait           the further behind you will get and the less you will understand.

There are also a bunch of listening tests on youtube, which is great for studying, but an easy way to get more hours in is          to watch Italian youtubers or something.

Question: AP Euro - DBQsWhat is the most efficient way to write a DBQ/how do I             remember all the formatting stuff? And why are DBQs the chosen format for exams? Possible Answer: There's really only one way to do it and you'll only ever get good at it with a lot of practice. Read             the question and know what its asking you. If you don't answer the question properly, its game over. Next, you have to read the sources that you're given. See what you can take out of them. Use those             annotation skills. Figure out how each source is related to the question. Now, you can start the outlining process. The most important part of any DBQ response is your thesis. It is the rock in which             your entire response its built on. Your thesis should answer the question and be able to be supported by your sources. You then have to think about what outside information you're going to bring into             your argument. Your outline should include what each paragraph is going to contain and what sources/supporting events you're going to use in simple terms. Once you have your outline, you can begin            writing your response by filling in the gaps of your outline. You should then include a decent conclusion that wraps up your response nicely. The whole point of taking any AP history course is to learn           how to think and write like a historian. I think DBQs do a great job of implementing all of the important skills that you should be learning when taking an AP history course. It shouldn't just be all           about memorizing dates and purely soaking up knowledge to get an A in the class. What you learn here, or what you should be learning, like being able to think critically and on your feet, will serve you          well later in life."},

            {role: "system", content: "I'm going to give you a question that you may be asked and the an answer to the question. Question: Does anyone know how to work these questions out ?? Possible Answer: In the            first question, RTC is a right angle since it is formed by the radius and the tangent lines of the circle intersecting.In any circle, a side-angle is half of the angle of the circle arc it faces.           Likewise, a central angle is equal to the angle of the circle arc it faces. Thus, the larger arc will be equal to 128 degrees (since a side-angle of 64 degrees is facing it.The sum of the angles of the           semi-circle is equal to 180 degrees, so the angle of the smaller arc will be equal to 180-128=52 degrees.Thus, the angle of the smaller central angle will be equal to 52 degrees, since it is facing the         smaller circle arc of 52 degrees. This angle is also a part of the right triangle, so we can use it to find the shaded angle. The sum of the angles of the right triangle will be 180 degrees. Lets call            the shaded angle, x. 90+52+x=180, so x=38.In the second question, the equation of the line will be of the form y=ax+b since it is linear. At x=0, 7=a*0+b. Thus, b=7. Similarly, at x=4, 0=4*a+b. We had          found b to be equal to 7. Thus, -4a=7, and a=-7/4.So, the equation of the line is y=(-7/4)*x+7."},

This is because, if there was genetic linkage, you would have alleles of BL           and bl from each parent, resulting in offspring of only black long fur or white short fur, unless crossing over occured, whereas unlinked genes would have possible alles of BL, Bl, bL, and bl, making           the two one dominant one recessive phenotypes much more common. This means that any short black or long white offspring in the F2 generation must be the result of crossing over, and so we simply find         the average number of those which is:((1 + 0) + (1 + 2) + (0 + 1) + (2 + 1) + (2 + 1))/5 = 2.2"},

The problem with this Possible Answer: hi! i got a 5 on ap art history last           year and this is what i did:i reviewed the 250 every night for thirty minutes after spring break. i made a quizlet with the images and each of the identifiers and then wrote down all of the identifiers           i missed. i also made quizlets with facts on each piece for each specific content area. i‚Äôd definitely focus more on the frqs once you get the 250 under your belt since for two of them you have to          attribute a piece to an artist, tribe, or movement (one of which isn‚Äôt in the 250) and explain its attribution."},

Question: MY GRADES DROPPEDI, an 11th grader have a full 6.0 schedule and I            maintained good grades for the first 2 quarters but I got 4 C's in the 3rd quarter.. If I get all A's and B's in my final quarter will I have a chance  Possible Answer: I'm going to assume your school            calculates GPAs on a quarterly schedule, because if it is on a semester schedule then as long as you get them up by the end of the semester it doesn't matter.Now, I will ask, what do you mean by a good           college? Do you mean a college at the level of an ivy league? If so, your chances are probably 0 unless you have really strong ECs. Do you mean a decent state school? If so, then you're probably fine as          long as you get your grades up. If it's something in between, then it will depend on how good the college is, how good your other grades were, and how good the rest of your application (ECs, essays,          test scores, etc.) is."},

Are there free full  practice tests that I can use? Possible Answer: Here are a few of the resources I have            used or heard about along with my experience with each and what I've heard about them from others:My main resource was the MIT practice book for AP Physics 1, which I think is a very good practice for            exam-like questions and just good practice for the concepts in general. Overall opinions on it from others were largely mixed.There is also always past FRQs, which are super helpful for getting used to           AP style questions and practicing your concepts. I think they were fairly helpful, and most others did as well. Overall opinions on it from others were largely positive.The most popular resource I've           seen my peers use is the AP Classroom daily videos/AP Classroom practice tests. I've never personally used them, but I've heard a lot of good things about them, though I've also heard some bad things         about it. If your teacher hasn't released these, you can ask them to so you can use them. Overall opinions on it from others were mixed but mostly positive. The next was The Organic Chemistry Tutor's           physics videos, which I've again never watched but have heard some good things about. Overall opinions from others were largely mixed. Some have also mentioned Flipping Physics, which I don't know much          about so can't comment too much on, but it does seem a bit less rigorous for the course than the previously mentioned ones (from what I've seen).Then there was Khan Academy, which I tried and found          pretty subpar and have had that experience corroborated by many of my peers, but a few said it was useful. Overall opinions on it were mostly negative.Those were the big ones that I know of.

I've been doing so bad on the timed             writings, especially the rhetorical analysis and synthesis. I don't know how people think of so much to write in such a short amount of t Possible Answer: Generally I felt that when people didn't know            what to write, it came from them trying to read the passages as fast as possible. You need to take your time reading the text you see given, and as you do so you need to be either annotating or making            mental notes of what you could right about. For the rhetorical analysis essay, these notes should in the form of chunking the prompt into major ideas and then noting important organizational and          stylistic choices to add onto the depth of your analysis. For the synthesis essay, the notes should be in the form of common motifs, ideas that build off of each other, and conflicting ideas between            texts that will allow you to find the main points of contention and explore the tensions formed between the texts around these points of contention. I guarantee you that if you practice taking these          notes, you *will* improve in how quickly you can recognize and discuss important ideas, and you will be able to write a lot more.

Colleges don‚Äôt really mind if you haven‚Äôt taken any cs classes. In fact, a lot of people go into cs having zero knowledge of coding beforehand. You‚Äôre initiative and interest           is mostly shown in your ec‚Äôs and essays. So APCSP is great for your gpa and, let‚Äôs face it, when you start getting senioritis it‚Äôs great to have APCSP and not some other semi-demanding AP class"},

My current plan is to take6-7 (2 in sophomore, 3 in junior, 2 in senior) but I'm afraid that Possible Answer: Work smarter,           not harder. Take what you feel is necessary. Colleges just want to see a good GPA (which can be obtained without taking any AP classes) and if you have good exam scores, they'll give you credit.If you            kind of already know what you want to do, take stuff that relates to it. I knew I wanted to be a history teacher, so I took as many history/social studies APs that were available to me. I didn't mess           around with any of the STEM APs because why would I?The worst thing you can do is overload your schedule to where you're now in burnout, past the point of no return, and you end up watching your GPA          crash and burn right before your very eyes."},

Most likely CThe scientist claims that             either the operon is mutated or the repressor protein(the product of the trpR gene) is mutated. Therefore, we are looking for an answer which supports these. If you look at choice C, you see that the             repressor protein/operator must not work correctly. The trp operon is a repressible operon. It is always on unless there is an abundance of tryptophan. When there is an abundance, the repressor protein           (which is constantly being made) binds to tryptophan and blocks the operator from transcribing the enzymes(for the synthesis of tryptophan) it was making. Now if the operon is transcribing when *there            is* a high abundance would mean the repressor protein/operator is not working correctly.The rest of the answer choices don't seem to make sense for this problem. I hope I am correct, lol."},

Question: How to earn the sophistication point on AP lang?Hi, I recently took an AP            Lang mock test and my teacher graded my essays with the following scores: Synthesis essay: 5/6 Rhetorical device essay: 5/6 Argumentative essay: 6/6 He said the only reason Possible Answer: Aaaagggh!           Such a tough question!  Honestly, the sophistication point goes beyond how you word your response.  It's more about being able to see and explain the complexity of your argument or the speaker's            argument, if you're doing a rhetorical analysis essay.No argument is completely one-sided (or else it wouldn't be an argument).  Validating the opposition's view and responding to it is one way to show           you get the complexity of the issue.  For example, fracking is a great solution for America's energy needs yet it comes at a cost to the environment and local humans.  Being able to say yes, opponents           of fracking have good points but until more sustainable energy is developed, it's a good way to keep vehicles running and homes heated is one way to explain its grey nature instead of making it sound        black and white.A few years ago, the rhetorical analysis essay analyzed a eulogy for Richard Nixon.  Talk about a complex situation!  A eulogy is supposed to say nice things but Nixon was definitely a           controversial president.  Essays that pointed out how the speaker dealt with this sticky situation got the sophistication point.It's hard to see the complexity of an issue in 40 minutes; practice with          sample prompts between now and the test.  Just be sure that in acknowledging the opposition you don't come off as not taking a stand at all.  See if that won't help your score :)  Good luck!"},

If your teacher is a fucking millennial dickhead who gets           hard-ons seeing sub 80s on powerschool, well then good luck. If your teacher is a fair, funny old guy who genuinely wants his students to interact with the material and himself, you'll do relatively            fine.AP Calc AB, to my understanding, is moderately hard if you're not a math wiz by nature. If you are then good for you.&amp;#x200B;APUSH is breeze asf holy shit there is absolutely nothing hard about          this fucking class&amp;#x200B;Anyways good luck on Junior year and remember to drop all sort of passion and entertainment in your life :)"},

Taking 6 tests this             year and I‚Äôm just completely overwhelmed with the amount of work. I can‚Äôt relax because I always have something else to get done.  Possible Answer: Hullo! Used to always stress about AP exams and stuff,            so I think I might be able to help a lil!1.) Don't overstudy. There's such a thing as studying too much. Like your muscles, your brain can get overused. Give yourself ample time to rest as both your            mental and emotional are huge factors in taking any exam. Pace that stuff out, it'll kill you if you do huge study sessions.2.) 6 APs is a lot. The most I had was 5, and that's right now and last year.           I can tell you right now that you're going to want to prioritize. Find your strengths, your weaknesses, and your wants. I cannot stress this enough, pace it out. Don't procrastinate, but don't overwork           yourself.3.) Failure is part of the process for studying, so don't get frustrated. Especially when you feel yourself getting frustrated, pause. Take a breather, do something fun, anything to calm you         down. Frustration begets mistakes.4.) When it's getting close to exam time, don't worry! You've prepared, you've done the best you can, and you've got it. Worrying and stress often leads to worse           performance, so keep your head held high! You're gonna do your best, and your best is enough. It doesn't matter if that is a 4, 2, or 5.Overall tip: Don't focus too much on APs! If you're aiming for Ivy         League or a similar level college, they're looking for leadership, extracurriculars, and maturity alongside your intelligence. Even if you're not, as my AP Lang teacher put it, you're not going to be          looking back on your life and thinking Wow, my biggest regret is failing that AP exam. The biggest tip I can ever give is taking care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically! Do not let        yourself be weighed down by your failures, and don't let your future exams shackle you.Good luck, you've got this!"},

For the mcq, you just have to remember the terms and how they look like in the music. For the            written frq, practice A LOT and score yourself based on the scoring rubrics. There are a lot of rules that the AP exam has that sometimes might not be in traditional music theory that you just have to          memorize. For the listening frq, also practice a lot. Try to find the solfege to melodies in songs you casually listen to and identify the chord progressions. For the sight singing, practice singing the            different intervals and get them in your ear. Remember to stay calm during the test so your throat doesn't close up haha. Hope this helps!"},

One of the questions on the quiz was: \[ Red is dominant homozygous, Orange is heterozygous, and Yellow is re Possible Answer: There are a few ways to approach this, but           you already know the percentage of homozygous individuals to the total population for both dominant and recessive (i.e. p^(2), q^(2)), so the simplest approach would simply be to square root that value           to find one of p or q first, then find the other by 1 - (p or q) = (q or p). P and q would then be your allele frequencies.i.e. Say we focus on the frequency of individuals that are homozygous for the          dominant trait. The total population is (homozygous dominant) + (heterozygous) + (homozygous recessive) = 56 + 92 + 23 = 171 and the homozygous dominant group makes up 56/171 of all the individuals, or           \~0.33 which is your p^(2) value. Then you take the square root of p^(2), or \~0.33, to find that p = 0.57, and if p + q = 1, then 0.57 + q = 1, so q = 0.43.Hopefully that helps! :)"},

While there was a small drop in the number of students taking ap exams overall in the May 2021 exams season, the AP Physics 2 exam and course overall ha Possible Answer: I think what you say is correct,            students use AP Physics 1 to get to AP Physics C, I have seen in high school course catalogs that in some schools AP Physics 1 is a prerequisite for AP Physics C which explains in part why the number of            AP Physics 1 students is higher than the number of AP Physics 2 students.  If I recall correctly, the original AP Physics 1 had electrical circuits so it might have been a better soft landing for C but           then they took circuits out and made it an exclusively mechanics class so I don't know if 1 works as well as a prep for a full C class (it would be for the mechanics class). If one wanted an AP C prep          class, they're probably better off with a non AP physics class that covered both mechanics and electricity and magnetism than AP 1 that spends an entire year on mechanics and no time on E&amp;M. Another          issue with AP 2 is that its target audience would probably be biology, medical, and health science majors and those students probably would rather take AP chemistry and AP biology than a second AP          physics class (they'll take one just to take all three major sciences but chemistry and biology are more of a priority."},

Aside from that, Stats is definitely more applicable in general and is certainly the easier exam, but I          honestly enjoyed Physics 1 a lot more than Stats, because I enjoy the content more.

If anyone knows please tell me and give me your source if you have one. Possible Answer: Depends on the question. The safe bet is to            always do so so that, when you are required to, you do so anyways. Questions will explicitly state Include units of measure,  but it isn't a bad idea to practice including units.E.g. 2017 AP Calculus           AB FRQ #1's first FRQ explicitly states to include units of measure. Given that the exams can share FRQs, one can safely assume that such a scenario is equally likely to occur. Be familiar with the           relationship between the units of measure, derivatives, and integration. For example, if a function v(t) is used for the velocity of a particle P in terms of kilometers per hour, the integration of v(t)        will be in kilometers. Especially in MCQs in the calculator portion, they will throw questions at you which require thinking like this.Tl;dr, yep."},

You'll also have to remember what types          of information placeholders (variables) actually contain.I went in with only about 50% of Codecademy's free Java course and did fine (but I did have a little practice with Scratch and Python in         elementary school, which probably helped with understanding the logic). Your classwork will probably include small projects, which should help with learning the sort of logical reasoning you need.Here's          a little Java slideshow, though it's incomplete: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skO3F6hkBQDTF0KiD2L-CFn-5UBIui0JH8Ln18EMOik/edit?usp=drivesdkAP Macro is largely about understanding/memorizing         several graphs and what makes them shift.

Question: Freaking Out RNHello, I had an 88.98 in my Calc class before the final, and            an 89 (sometimes 88.5) gets rounded up to an A. I studied harder than any other test in my life and I felt really good and thought it was  Possible Answer: First, calm down. What‚Äôs done has been done,            there is nothing you can do. So, there‚Äôs no point in panicking and beating yourself up. Unless the teacher genuinely made an error (which is extremely unlikely), your grade is what it is. Getting a B in          an AP class is equivalent to an A in a regular class in terms of GPA. You will be okay. Getting one B+ is not going to ruin your whole life, and it‚Äôs not going to be the determining factor in whether or            not you get into your dream school. I know many people who have even gone as far as failing a class and still have gotten into an ivy or a T20. There are still many more chances to redeem yourself. Go          and talk to your teacher and go over your test, and learn from what you did wrong and do better next time.Also, regardless of whether or not hitting is acceptable as a form of punishment in your          culture, it‚Äôs still incredibly wrong and I am sorry you had to go through that. I grew up in a strict Asian household where this was normalized, but it really shouldn‚Äôt be. You tried your best and put       in a lot of effort, and that‚Äôs all that matters.

Question: Is it worth it to take AP classes as a senior?During senior year,            applications to college are typically sent in around January due to most applications having their deadline in January. Midterm grades would not be in yet, specifically for me. The Possible Answer: Yes.            Many colleges ask for your second semester grades after applications are already submitted. Additionally, schools can still see active enrollment and that does look better than if you suddenly stop           taking the classes. AP scores don't have much effect on college admissions anyways, so the scores should only be a concern if you're looking to get college credit. Just be careful that you don't push           yourself too much, as it's not worth doing so especially when you have college essays to write and maybe even SATs to study for still."},

Question: What to do after AP CSA I am taking AP computer science a this year and I‚Äôm            hoping to do more computer science before college. I‚Äôm planning to be a comp sci major. I have many options and am hoping for some input.  Optio Possible Answer: Option 1: I have never heard of any           intro cs class that incorporates what you learned in calc into the actual class itself. But maybe look at the course description to confirm that. If you find out that you wouldn't be applying any direct            calc classes, this seems like a good option for me. Just try to take a class that won't go over everything you learned in csa all over again.Option 2: I wouldn't recommend taking APCSP even before          taking CSA. It barely goes into programming and isn't what most people expect when they take a cs class. If you've already completed CSA, i feel like there is no reason to even glance at csp. Option 3:         Although Harvard's CS50 course is very good, I'm not sure how much you'll enojoy doing it if you've already gone through a class like APCSA. Even if you were to complete it, it wouldn't hold much weight          in the admissions process. Option 4: Seems like a good option. Keep in mind though, taking cs classes at school isn't the only way to keep those skills fresh. Building side project or doing things           similar to leetcode, could be another way to do it. If I were in your situation, I would try to take the next level cs class as dual enrollment and take math class at your school. But I personally          wouldn't take the most basic intro level class at a cc because APCSA is supposed to represent an intro level class."},

Question: How to find the shortest distance between (0,1) and x^2?Been wondering the             answer to this bc it popped up somewhere awhile ago lol Possible Answer: First, let y = x^(2). Then, let's find us a formula for the distance S between a point (x, y) and (0, 1). This, using the            pythagorean theorem, is obviously:S = sqrt((y - 1)^2 + (x^(2)))Plugging in for y gives us:S = sqrt(x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^(2))Simplifying this by expanding and combining like terms gives:S = sqrt(x^(4) - x^2 +            1)Now, to find the minimum value of this function on the interval (-‚àû, ‚àû), we must first take the derivative of this function with respect to x. In other words, we must find dS/dx, which is done using          the chain and power rules for derivatives, giving us:dS/dx = (4x^3 - 2x)/(2sqrt(x^4 - x^2 + 1))Which simplifies to:dS/dx = (2x^2 - 1)x/(sqrt(x^4 - x^2 + 1)Now to find the possible local minima of this            function, we must find where it changes sign, so we must see where this derivative either equals zero or does not exist. We know that it always exists as the denominator is always positive, so we simply          set the numerator equal to zero to solve for this x values:(2x^2 - 1)x = 0Solving for x we get:x = sqrt(1/2), x = 0, or x = -sqrt(1/2)Now, we construct a number line to find the intervals on which this         function is increasing and decreasing to determine the candidates for our absolute minima. Doing this, we find that our distance is decreasing on the intervals (-‚àû, -sqrt(1/2)) and (0, sqrt(1/2)), and         is increasing on the interval (-sqrt(1/2), 0) and (sqrt(1/2), ‚àû). This means that we know our local minima are at -sqrt(1/2) and sqrt(1/2), and as the distance goes to infinity as x tends to positive or           negative infinity, we know our absolute minimum value for S must be at one of (or both of) these values of x. Now, we simply plug in these values to find our absolute minimum value for S. Here we get:S         (sqrt(1/2)) = sqrt((-sqrt(1/2))^4 - (sqrt(1/2))^2 + 1) = sqrt(1/4 - 1/2 + 1) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2And of course, because all values of x have even powers, S is even and thus S(-sqrt(1/2)) also equals           sqrt(3)/2. Thus the minimum distance between x^2 and (0, 1) is sqrt(3)/2."},

I personally used [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com) a lot, but I've heard good things about [codechef.com]            (https://codechef.com), which appears to even have a competitive option.3.

I've been staring at this            question for the past hour and still can't understand what it means even with the model answer Possible Answer: first of all, what the heckBut what y is proportional to x\^2 means is that the equation            of y in terms of x will be quadratic. (the equation is actually y = xtan(angle) - gsec\^2(angle)\*x\^2/2v smth like this)so in order to prove that they are proportional, all we need is the measure the          horizontal displacement x, and the vertical displacement y, and just show that the equation is quadratic, which is why in the answer key there are only two measurements needed. (so put in the procedure           to make a graph and show that the relationship is quadratic.) remember, extra measurements actually marks down your score.now the reason why the key measures it a couple times is to reduce uncertainty,         it's just like an algebra problem. if you are given a couple points to a graph, you have a better idea of what the behavior of the graph is, but no conclusive way to prove it. (unless im dumb) like (1,         1) and (2,4) doesn't tell you what type of graph it is, but if you are given (3,9) and (4,16), you have a better idea.hope this helps and good luck in the ap test"},

Question: Any self study precal to take calc bc advice?I am currently in algebra 2,            but plan to take pre calculus over the summer in order to take bc next year. For precal, i plan on using openstax, khan academy, and the course im required to take to self Possible Answer: In my            opinion, there are a few things you should learn or get more comfortable with in PreCalc that you *need* to know and there are a few things that are *good* to know, but aren't necessary.Here is what you          need to know:1. A general solid understanding of algebra and algebraic manipulation, as well as various important ideas in algebra such as factoring polynomials2. The trigonometric functions and their            graphs3. The unit circle and standard values for sine, cosine, and ideally tangent4. The inverse trigonometric functions and standard values for them5. Trig identities (specifically it is good to know          the double angle formulas and power lowering formulas for sine and cosine, as well as all of the pythagorean identities)6. A good understanding of exponential functions and logarithms as well as the          exponent and log rules7. An understanding of what sequences and series are and sigma notation for seriesHere is what is good to know but not necessary (you will need to know this eventually, but it is       going to be taught in your Calc class):1. A basic understanding of what tangent lines and secant lines are2. A basic idea of what limits and derivatives are3. How to do polynomial division and partial             fraction decomposition4. What polar functions are and how to graph them5. What parametric functions are and how to graph them6. What vectors are, what vector valued functions are, and what they             represent7. An understanding of what infinite series are, and possibly a more in depth understanding of geometric and power seriesThat's about all I can think of right now, but feel free to ask if there            is anything else you might be confused about (or if you're interested in private tutoring, feel free to dm me, but that can be pricey so no pressure).

I want to Possible Answer: Some schools may require            pre med or biology majors to take calculus so it would be to your advantage to take AP calculus in high school. It is best to check the schools you wish to apply to and their pre med program          requirements.

So every little disc of thickness dy will have a volume of:dV = œÄr^(2)dr = œÄ(3 - y^(2))^(2)drNow, we want to            integrate this but we don't yet have an upper bound on y (lower bound is obviously 0).

You sign up for them like you would any           other class. The classes are like any other class you would take in high school, just as a much faster pace. The policies around taking AP classes will depend on the school you attend Some school offer           all AP classes, some offer none, most sit somewhere in between. It depends on the school you will being attending. The prerequisites for AP classes also vary between schools. For example, one school        might require Algebra 2 for AP Physics, while another might only require Algebra 1. This is the same for grades, some might have a grade requirement, some might not. You can take as many AP exams as you            want, though I really would not recommend taking more than 10 total.

For example, if you argue that the Cold War changed            US foreign policy, give an example (or two, if you can) of US policy during the Cold War. For the sbmc, mossstttt of the time the answer will be in the stimulus, but when it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôll be something           from around the same period. I would try and get good at periodization and knowing what thing happened in what period, so you can make connections from the same period. Usually you can eliminate a          couple of choices just because they‚Äôre out of the period presented in the stimulus. I hope those tips help you in your studying, and may you see a 5 in July!!"},

Question: calc pls help, i never understood error bound‚Ä¶ignore the triangles, im             suffering Possible Answer: Let's suppose we have an alternating sequence s(n), and we are taking the sum of that sequence times the alternating part (in this case starting at 1, but it could start at             any number) up to some number k:n=1Œ£^(k)s(n)Then, let the error of this approximation be R. From the alternating series error bound, we know:|R| &lt;= |s(n+1)|I will not get into why this is true, but            if you are interested you can look it up. So, in our case, they took f(1/2) so our s(n) is going to be:s(n) = (-1)^(n+1)(1/2)^(2n)/(2n+1)!And because they want the fourth degree Taylor polynomial, that           means that the highest power of x should be 4, so that will happen at n = 2. Thus, they took the partial sum up to n = 2.

We know that cosŒ∏ is nothing but x/15, and in our          case the problem tells us that x is 9, so secŒ∏ is 15/9. Additionally, the problem tells us that y is *decreasing* by 2ft/sec, so dy/dt is -2ft/sec.

We know that the voltage across the capacitor will be the same as the voltage across R2 as they are connected in parallel, but           we also know that R2 and the capacitor must share the total voltage of the battery with R1.

How Possible Answer: There are a few key ideas that           are (usually) taught in PreCalc that you need for Calc BC, but nothing too difficult (in my opinion). These are:1. Partial Fraction Decomposition 2. Various trig identities and formula 3. Polar graphs            and equations 4. Parametric graphs and equations5. Vectors and vector arithmeticAnd of course, a strong foundation in algebra that often gets cultivated in PreCalc in general is very necessary for the          class, along with other stuff that you should have learned in prior classes (e.g. Factoring, log rules, unit circle). Additionally, if you're not as mathematically gifted, it's probably not a good idea         to just jump in. I suggest trying to go into the class with a good understanding of some of the basic concepts of Calculus *before* the class even starts (i.e. limits and how to find them algebraically         + what a derivative is and some basic derivative rules). Being ahead in Calculus makes the class significantly easier, so it is something I always strongly advocate for.If you need additional help, feel           free to ask me or others online as there are often people available (and if you're looking for a tutor, feel free to dm me as I do tutoring professionally).

So try to put more emphasis on that, and then determine how rigorous you want your schedule to be.I recommend dropping Research for something else.

You don‚Äôt need pre-calc to be           successful in a Calc course, you‚Äôll build up a good foundation in AB.  Most of the people at my school skip it, and they do perfectly fine, including me.

A. What is the maximum speed of the tip of the needle? B. What is the ma Possible            Answer: Off the top of my head, I don‚Äôt recall how you would do A and B without calculus or just being provided equations. So let‚Äôs go with the latter: the equation for max velocity is that max v=(2pi*f)         *A and the equation for max acceleration is max a=(2pi*f)^2*A.(Side note: if you know calculus, yours just taking the first and second derivative of the postition equation from your formula sheet, x=Acos           (2pi*f*t), where A is amplitude and f is frequency, and then solving for the maximum x value which is the cos or sin function solves to 1.For C, you know the frequency, and you know that frequency is           the reciprocal of period. The time from the highest to lowest point is half of a cycle, so that‚Äôs half the period.For D, within a single cycle, the object will travel four times the amplitude. And          you‚Äôve already solved for period. So that should be easy from there."},

A             passing score on the Lang exam will get you out of either a part of or the whole university/college writing requirement. Everyone has this requirement no matter what their major is. A passing score on            Lit will either get you credit for a basic 100-level lit course or, worst case scenario, english departmental credit.

I‚Äôd recommend Barron‚Äôs book or just practicing fake conversations with a native          speaker. also memorize several common idioms and chinese myths, sports, foods etc. if you are native this exam is cake. good luck!"},

Possible Answer: Watching every single video by Heimler‚Äôs History and reading the Princeton Review book is pretty much what you need to pass             the exam. Do practice MCQs from the Princeton Review and past FRQs on the College Board website. Heimler has great content reviews and guides to answer all the MCQ, SAQ, DBQ, and LEQ on the exam.The            exam is more general than the content you learn in class so be sure to focus on overall themes connecting events together (SPICE-T) but still know specific examples relating to those themes.

I have **bad grammar skills** so I'm super sorry in advance if it's hard to read.  **Background In Possible             Answer: History-wise, I‚Äôm sort of in the same position as you.  I like it a lot, I‚Äôm good at it, but there‚Äôs some things that just bore me.  But, I found APUSH extremely interesting, and I couldn‚Äôt get             enough of it.  Maybe that‚Äôs because I have an amazing teacher, but still, I highly recommend the course.  It‚Äôll make you aware of things many people in America aren‚Äôt, and you‚Äôll get a lot of college             credit for it, more than AP HUGE and World.  You won‚Äôt have to take an American history course again.As for pre-calc, I don‚Äôt recommend taking it.  90% of the stuff it covers isn‚Äôt used in Calc.  The             only thing that it does cover that you‚Äôll use in Calc is trig, but that‚Äôll be drilled into you regardless.  Take this from a Calc BC student who sat through five minutes of pre-calc once and didn‚Äôt             understand wtf was going on.  Instead, maybe you should take AP Stats since you‚Äôre a business major.  Or, you can jump straight to Calc AB.  Colleges will like it more, and again, you don‚Äôt need pre            calc at all.  Most of the kids in the Calc classes at my school, including me, didn‚Äôt take it.Good luck on deciding your classes!"},

Question: Do you think the AP course restrictions to specific grade levels and             requirements make sense in your school?While I graduated from HS and I haven't taken an AP exam in years, I still think about AP exams. In my high school, the requirements for AP courses do not make            sense.  Examples:  1) Only 9th graders Possible Answer: Our school does things very similarly. In 9th it‚Äôs because they want students to step into the rigor of AP gradually and Human Geo is a good AP           for that. In 10th AP world is taught as though it‚Äôs a first AP. They teach how to do DBQ, SAQ, MCQ as part of the course curriculum. At our school you could, hypothetically, take this class if you are            past 10th grade but I‚Äôve never seen anyone do it. We also allow AP Psych in 10th but I didn‚Äôt take it so I don‚Äôt know how they teach it. School suggests no more than 2 AP 10th grade year, I don‚Äôt know          if they allow exceptions. In 11th, we have free reign on most AP classes as long as we have completed the pre-requisites. Only exception is AP Lit which is 12th only. Our school suggests no more than 3         AP 11th grade but you can get an exception to do more. 12th grade can take any AP course offered as long as pre-requisites are met. Again, School suggested maximum is 3 AP but exceptions are made. For          any of these exceptions, you have to explain why you want to take the classes, how you plan to succeed, and you are expected to hold up your end of the deal. The system seems to work in favor of not           over-facing students and allowing them to increase rigor year over year."},

And don't wait to start doing this. You need to be reviewing *now*, because the longer you wait           the further behind you will get and the less you will understand.

In addition, I just mentally clock out half way because I am so confused lmao. Any tips or resources to Possible           Answer: I've never taken an AP language test, but I enjoy learning languages, so this is where I'm coming from, but I imagine it shouldn't really matter.Anyway, for listening comprehension, literally           the only way to get better is to just consume a ton of media. Typically having a transcript also helps but are training wheels in that they're great to learn with, but you need to take them off         eventually.Also, don't get caught up on individual words, just try to listen for what you can and try not to analyze it word by word.So literally just watch a bunch of Italian youtubers/movies/           documentaries with subtitles on and audiobooks/podcasts with a transcription. There are also a bunch of listening tests on youtube, which is great for studying, but an easy way to get more hours in is          to watch Italian youtubers or something. EasyItalian is a great medium between fun and educational and I love their content, would really recommend you check them out."},

Question: AP Euro - DBQsWhat is the most efficient way to write a DBQ/how do I             remember all the formatting stuff? And why are DBQs the chosen format for exams? Possible Answer: There's really only one way to do it and you'll only ever get good at it with a lot of practice. Read             the question and know what its asking you. If you don't answer the question properly, its game over. Next, you have to read the sources that you're given. See what you can take out of them. Use those             annotation skills. Figure out how each source is related to the question. Now, you can start the outlining process. The most important part of any DBQ response is your thesis. It is the rock in which             your entire response its built on. Your thesis should answer the question and be able to be supported by your sources. You then have to think about what outside information you're going to bring into             your argument. Your outline should include what each paragraph is going to contain and what sources/supporting events you're going to use in simple terms. Once you have your outline, you can begin            writing your response by filling in the gaps of your outline. You should then include a decent conclusion that wraps up your response nicely. The whole point of taking any AP history course is to learn           how to think and write like a historian. I think DBQs do a great job of implementing all of the important skills that you should be learning when taking an AP history course. It shouldn't just be all           about memorizing dates and purely soaking up knowledge to get an A in the class. What you learn here, or what you should be learning, like being able to think critically and on your feet, will serve you          well later in life."},

Possible Answer: In the            first question, RTC is a right angle since it is formed by the radius and the tangent lines of the circle intersecting.In any circle, a side-angle is half of the angle of the circle arc it faces.           Likewise, a central angle is equal to the angle of the circle arc it faces. Thus, the larger arc will be equal to 128 degrees (since a side-angle of 64 degrees is facing it.The sum of the angles of the           semi-circle is equal to 180 degrees, so the angle of the smaller arc will be equal to 180-128=52 degrees.Thus, the angle of the smaller central angle will be equal to 52 degrees, since it is facing the         smaller circle arc of 52 degrees. This angle is also a part of the right triangle, so we can use it to find the shaded angle. The sum of the angles of the right triangle will be 180 degrees. Lets call            the shaded angle, x. 90+52+x=180, so x=38.In the second question, the equation of the line will be of the form y=ax+b since it is linear. At x=0, 7=a*0+b. Thus, b=7. Similarly, at x=4, 0=4*a+b. We had          found b to be equal to 7. Thus, -4a=7, and a=-7/4.So, the equation of the line is y=(-7/4)*x+7."},

I visited the campus a bit ago and it is very nice.Anyways, if it helps, Khan Academy and the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube are both pretty good resources for AP Calc.             Additionally, I personally am a big fan of Paul's, which is a bit more academically rigorous than the former two but is at times harder to understand as well. If you have any specific questions, I would            be happy to answer them (and I am sure there are many others online who would as well), though I myself am often busy with tutoring and my own schoolwork. You can also try talking with your peers, as           they may be a bit more receptive to your needing of help than it seems your teacher is.No matter what, though, I wish you luck and hope you can succeed!

This is because, if there was genetic linkage, you would have alleles of BL           and bl from each parent, resulting in offspring of only black long fur or white short fur, unless crossing over occured, whereas unlinked genes would have possible alles of BL, Bl, bL, and bl, making           the two one dominant one recessive phenotypes much more common. This means that any short black or long white offspring in the F2 generation must be the result of crossing over, and so we simply find         the average number of those which is:((1 + 0) + (1 + 2) + (0 + 1) + (2 + 1) + (2 + 1))/5 = 2.2"},

Are there free full  practice tests that I can use? Possible Answer: Here are a few of the resources I have            used or heard about along with my experience with each and what I've heard about them from others:My main resource was the MIT practice book for AP Physics 1, which I think is a very good practice for            exam-like questions and just good practice for the concepts in general. Overall opinions on it from others were largely mixed.There is also always past FRQs, which are super helpful for getting used to           AP style questions and practicing your concepts. I think they were fairly helpful, and most others did as well. Overall opinions on it from others were largely positive.The most popular resource I've           seen my peers use is the AP Classroom daily videos/AP Classroom practice tests. I've never personally used them, but I've heard a lot of good things about them, though I've also heard some bad things         about it. If your teacher hasn't released these, you can ask them to so you can use them. Overall opinions on it from others were mixed but mostly positive. The next was The Organic Chemistry Tutor's           physics videos, which I've again never watched but have heard some good things about. Overall opinions from others were largely mixed. Some have also mentioned Flipping Physics, which I don't know much          about so can't comment too much on, but it does seem a bit less rigorous for the course than the previously mentioned ones (from what I've seen).Then there was Khan Academy, which I tried and found          pretty subpar and have had that experience corroborated by many of my peers, but a few said it was useful. Overall opinions on it were mostly negative.Those were the big ones that I know of.

I don't know how people think of so much to write in such a short amount of t Possible Answer: Generally I felt that when people didn't know            what to write, it came from them trying to read the passages as fast as possible. You need to take your time reading the text you see given, and as you do so you need to be either annotating or making            mental notes of what you could right about. For the rhetorical analysis essay, these notes should in the form of chunking the prompt into major ideas and then noting important organizational and          stylistic choices to add onto the depth of your analysis. For the synthesis essay, the notes should be in the form of common motifs, ideas that build off of each other, and conflicting ideas between            texts that will allow you to find the main points of contention and explore the tensions formed between the texts around these points of contention. I guarantee you that if you practice taking these          notes, you *will* improve in how quickly you can recognize and discuss important ideas, and you will be able to write a lot more.

Most likely CThe scientist claims that             either the operon is mutated or the repressor protein(the product of the trpR gene) is mutated. Therefore, we are looking for an answer which supports these. If you look at choice C, you see that the             repressor protein/operator must not work correctly. The trp operon is a repressible operon. It is always on unless there is an abundance of tryptophan. When there is an abundance, the repressor protein           (which is constantly being made) binds to tryptophan and blocks the operator from transcribing the enzymes(for the synthesis of tryptophan) it was making.

Such a tough question!  Honestly, the sophistication point goes beyond how you word your response.  It's more about being able to see and explain the complexity of your argument or the speaker's            argument, if you're doing a rhetorical analysis essay.No argument is completely one-sided (or else it wouldn't be an argument).  Validating the opposition's view and responding to it is one way to show           you get the complexity of the issue.  For example, fracking is a great solution for America's energy needs yet it comes at a cost to the environment and local humans.  Being able to say yes, opponents           of fracking have good points but until more sustainable energy is developed, it's a good way to keep vehicles running and homes heated is one way to explain its grey nature instead of making it sound        black and white.A few years ago, the rhetorical analysis essay analyzed a eulogy for Richard Nixon.  Talk about a complex situation!  A eulogy is supposed to say nice things but Nixon was definitely a           controversial president.  Essays that pointed out how the speaker dealt with this sticky situation got the sophistication point.It's hard to see the complexity of an issue in 40 minutes; practice with          sample prompts between now and the test.  Just be sure that in acknowledging the opposition you don't come off as not taking a stand at all.  See if that won't help your score :)  Good luck!"},

Taking 6 tests this             year and I‚Äôm just completely overwhelmed with the amount of work. I can‚Äôt relax because I always have something else to get done.  Possible Answer: Hullo! Used to always stress about AP exams and stuff,            so I think I might be able to help a lil!1.) Don't overstudy. There's such a thing as studying too much. Like your muscles, your brain can get overused. Give yourself ample time to rest as both your            mental and emotional are huge factors in taking any exam. Pace that stuff out, it'll kill you if you do huge study sessions.2.) 6 APs is a lot. The most I had was 5, and that's right now and last year.           I can tell you right now that you're going to want to prioritize. Find your strengths, your weaknesses, and your wants. I cannot stress this enough, pace it out. Don't procrastinate, but don't overwork           yourself.3.) Failure is part of the process for studying, so don't get frustrated. Especially when you feel yourself getting frustrated, pause. Take a breather, do something fun, anything to calm you         down. Frustration begets mistakes.4.) When it's getting close to exam time, don't worry! You've prepared, you've done the best you can, and you've got it. Worrying and stress often leads to worse           performance, so keep your head held high! You're gonna do your best, and your best is enough. It doesn't matter if that is a 4, 2, or 5.Overall tip: Don't focus too much on APs! If you're aiming for Ivy         League or a similar level college, they're looking for leadership, extracurriculars, and maturity alongside your intelligence. Even if you're not, as my AP Lang teacher put it, you're not going to be          looking back on your life and thinking Wow, my biggest regret is failing that AP exam. The biggest tip I can ever give is taking care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically! Do not let        yourself be weighed down by your failures, and don't let your future exams shackle you.Good luck, you've got this!"},

Find a good review book, free or otherwise (I           like the MIT practice workbook which has a free pdf online, even though the answer key makes mistakes sometimes) and do as many problems as you can.

For the mcq, you just have to remember the terms and how they look like in the music. For the            written frq, practice A LOT and score yourself based on the scoring rubrics. There are a lot of rules that the AP exam has that sometimes might not be in traditional music theory that you just have to          memorize. For the listening frq, also practice a lot. Try to find the solfege to melodies in songs you casually listen to and identify the chord progressions. For the sight singing, practice singing the            different intervals and get them in your ear. Remember to stay calm during the test so your throat doesn't close up haha. Hope this helps!"},
